"Communism is the major menace of our time."
"International communism will never rest until the whole world, including the United States, is under the hammer and sickle."
"Communism is more than an economic, political, social, or philosophical doctrine."
"The Party member may physically reside in the United States, but he 'lives' in a communist 'world.'"
"The Party’s objective is to produce a 'politically mature' comrade—'communist man'—who will work ceaselessly for the revolution that would make our United States part of the Soviet system."
